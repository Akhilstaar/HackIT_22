I had to leave the last meet early and hence studied from multiple different sources

#UNIX file system

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#vim
-vim is a very versatile and a lightweight program, althhoughh it might look hard to use on the surface but with enough practice and getting used to it can increase productivity by a lot
-vim is a UNIX text editor and can be integrated with VS code for a more user friendly experience, it just uses vimm interface and keybinds 
-Installing vim:
    1) vim can be installed by using sudo ap-get vim in LINUX and open a file using vim <filename>
    2) in VS code it can be installed by extensions and then open 
-when a file is opened in vim it will take you to commannd mode and you can switch to insert mode by pressing 'i' and write to the file
-to exit insert mode simply press 'esc'
-in command mode some basic keybinds are mentioned below
    h-navigate left
    j-navigate down
    k-navigate up
    l-navigate right
    w-jump to start of word
    e-jump to end of word
    0-jump to the start of the line
    :q-quit vim
    :w-write (save) the file
    :wq:write and escape
    yy-yank (copy) a line 
    p
