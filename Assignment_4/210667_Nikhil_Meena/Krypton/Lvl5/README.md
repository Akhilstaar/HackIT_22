# Level 5 Walkthrough

## Password to Level 6
> RANDOM

## Description

Frequency analysis can break a known key length as well.  Lets try one
last polyalphabetic cipher, but this time the key length is unknown.


Enjoy.

Using the same website which was used in the previous level it can be found that the key is `frekey`. Since, the paragraph solved by that is making more sense.

The password can be decode using the key.
