# Repository for HackIT'22 Summer Project

This repo would be used to document mentees' writeups for the provided Assignments.

## Assignment 0

Make a writeup about what you understood about `UNIX filesystem` and `vim`.  
Document the shortcuts and concepts you learnt, more comprehensive, better score (relatively scored throughout the project :). Just don't copy from somewhere (if you found it on the internet, so would we)  
Please fork this repository, clone it locally, put your writeup names as
`2XXXXX_YourName.md` in the corresponding [assignment folder](./Assignment_0). Commit with meaningful message, push to your remote origin, and make a pull request(PR) to this repo's `main` branch.  
You may work on a new branch on your fork, but PR on this main only.  
Note that the upcoming Assignments won't be submitted in this manner. This is
done to help you understand a basic workflow of git.

Submit a PR **by Sunday, May 29th 2022**, no deadline extension. You can of
course submit before!
